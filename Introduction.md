We proudly introduce to you our marvellous prototype that we believe has the potential to revolutionise the world of Cantonese opera, JyutOp -- An aid for your own Cantonese Opera.
JyutOp is a digital platform that aims to make Cantonese opera more accessible for everyone by removing the barrier for the enjoyment of the opera pieces and also providing assistance for the creation of a performance.

Our design has three main components, the Opera Explorer, Custom Design and the script-writing assistance, each of which has its own unique function and area of responsibility.

Starting with the Opera Explorer, as the name may suggest, it is a tool which allows users - specifically new or international audiences - to browse a catalog of information on Cantonese opera pieces. 
The benefits brought by this features are obvious. It could lower the threshold for people understanding the Cantonese Opera and remove language barriers for the international audience as it provides bilingual information of the pieces. 
Moreover, It also brings great convenience as users no longer need to search for useful information among the multitudes of websites on the Internet. 
We hope that with the above functionality, user especially new and international audiences will gain a better understanding of Chinese Opera.

Then, Costume Design. It could output some chinese opera costume design suggestions based on the user’s input.

Next, Script-writing Assistance. The script-writing assistance, powered by GPT-3.5-turbo model, aims to assist the creation of a performance by automatically generate a Cantonese opera script based on the user’s input. 
The original intention of the above function is not to completely replace those scriptwriters or costume designers, but to provide inspiration to creators through the output generated by ai, or rather this function can also allow the general public to experience the pleasure of creating Cantonese opera.

Here, we have integrated all of the prototype features into a singular application - a pilot model of JyutOp. The prototype is written in Python, with the user interface created using the package Flet. 

The model for Opera Explorer currently includes a catalogue browser for the synopsis as well as other details for several well-known Cantonese opera pieces - including the Flower Princess, which is being used as a demo prompt here.
A user can enter the lyrics or the name of an opera piece they wish to browse, and related information will be displayed in a concise manner.

Let's dive deeper into the fascinating core of our project - our innovative Custom Text-to-Image model, tailored specifically for generating images of Cantonese Opera masks from textual descriptions. 
This model is the result of an intricate fusion of two powerful architectures - Stability.ai’s Stable Diffusion model and the Vector-Quantization-Variational-Autoencoder-version-2 model.

The possible development of our product includes three points: 

Firstly, Vicuna is a large language model that has been fine-tuned from LLaMa with a massive amount of text data, and is known for its superior performance in natural language processing tasks.
Using Vicuna as the large language model can potentially improve the performance of the text-to-image model. 
By running Vicuna locally, we can have more control over the training process and experiment with various hyperparameters to optimise the performance of the model. 

Secondly, The text-to-image model generates images based on textual descriptions, and its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the training data and the training process.
To improve the performance of the model, we can train it for a longer period of time with a larger and more diverse dataset, and use more advanced training codes that are optimised for generating high-quality images, which can be possibly done in the near future. 
This can potentially lead to better training results and more realistic images.

Thirdly, training a text-to-image model can be computationally intensive, especially when using large datasets and complex models. 
Acquiring more advanced computational resources, such as A100 GPU servers, can significantly speed up the training process and enable researchers to experiment with larger and more complex models. 
This can potentially lead to better performance and more accurate image generation. 
Additionally, advanced computational resources can allow for more efficient hyperparameter tuning, which can further optimise the performance of the model.

We believe that our design can have a significant positive impact on this traditional art form. 
By preserving cultural heritage, increasing accessibility and fostering creativity, this technology can help with the survival and thrive of Cantonese opera for generations to come, not to mention that some of its features will be updated and enhanced in the future to be more relevant to the times. 
What we hope is that in the years to come, in a Cantonese Opera performance, the audience will no longer be the old faces same as decades ago, but more and more young faces will appear btoh on and off stage. 
Cantonese opere, the masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity, the essence of Chiense culture should not be lost in the great wheel of time, should not fade out of our view without our notice, and we also do not want it to disappear into thin air.
